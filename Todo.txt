Functionality:
--------------
1) Add preference page to set save interval.
2) Get the time interval for saving dirty editors from preferences.
3) Save into the metadata area (thanks to Douglas Pollock for suggesting this: 
   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=34076#c14)
   Currently, we save into the same directory as the original file - with a '~' before the name.
4) In case of abnormal shutdown (ie the snapshot file is still present), on next startup,
   resolve conflicts by bringing up a compare window.

Support:
--------
1) Host project.
2) Create help/usage docs.
3) Create home page.
4) Create update site.
