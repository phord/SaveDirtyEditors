Functionality:
--------------
1) Add preference page to set save interval.
2) Save into the metadata area (thanks to Douglas Pollock for suggesting this: 
   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=34076#c14)
   Currently, we save into the same directory as the original file - with a '~' before the name.
3) In case of abnormal shutdown (ie the snapshot file is still present), on next startup,
   resolve conflicts by bringing up a compare window.

Support:
--------
1) Host project.
2) Create help/usage docs.
3) Create home page.
4) Create update site.
