Changes in ver 1.0.1
********************
[Misc]
	o) Remove the snapshot when the editor is saved - since this leaves the snapshot lying
	   around without any use and could previously cause false positives on reconciliation
	   events.
	o) Various Performance enhancements (jobs are intelligently woken up/put to sleep).
[Bug]
	o) When using multiple monitors, if there was a reconciliation message popup, it
	   could appear in any random workbench window - not necessarily the one where the editor
	   was opened that prompted the reconciliation.

Changes in ver 1.0.0
********************
[Feature]
	o) Added preference page to set save interval and snapshot prefix/suffix.
	o) Since the snapshots are stored in the same project directories as the originals, 
	   if the users change prefix and/or suffix of the snapshot file name, the users will 
	   have to manually filter out the snapshot files from the navigator, package explorer
	   or any other views that they normally use (by applying the named filters). If the users
	   use the default settings - then the snapshot files are automatically filtered.

Changes in ver 0.0.5
********************
[Feature]
	o) Added Reconcile action: If its detected that the previous run of Eclipse shutdown
	   abnormally, this shows a confirmation popup to determine whether the user wants to
	   compare the differences and then proceeds to show the compare dialog if the user
	   accepted.
[Misc]
	o) Changed the format of the snapshot file to be adjustable by user preference - since 
	   .java files will some extension appended at the end so that the compiler does not 
	   complain. The default prefix is an empty string and the default suffix is '.snapshot'.
	   Some users might want to keep both the prefix and suffix as empty strings - but this
	   preference will save to the original file and will cause problems whenever the editor 
	   loses focus - for eg when a refactoring dialog is opened). Use this with care!
[Note]
	o) Since the snapshots are stored in the same project directories as the originals, 
	   the users of this plugin will have to manually filter out the snapshot files from 
	   the navigator, package explorer or any other views that they normally use.

Changes in ver 0.0.4
********************
[Misc] 
	o) Fixed a bug wherein editors for class files (with attached sources) would fail.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes in ver 0.0.3
********************
[Feature]
	o) Saves contents of dirty editors on a time-based schedule. Currently this
	   happens every 5 minutes and cannot be set using preferences - next version
	   will have a Preference page where this can be modified.
[Misc] 
    o) Totally revamped the inner workings.
    o) Now creates temporary files in the workspace at the same location as the
       file being edited - just with a '~' in front of the original file name so
       as to differentiate the two. This snapshot file will be removed when the
       editor or the workbench window is closed (which will save the dirty file).
       If Eclipse crashes, and the workbench is closed without following the normal
       routine, the snapshot file will be left behind. Currently the user will have
       to manually reconcile the differences.
    o) Externalized messages into properties file.
